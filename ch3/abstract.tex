\section*{Abstract} \label{abstract}

We explore the framework of a real-time coupled cluster method with a focus on
improving its computational efficiency.  Propagation of the wave function via the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation places high demands on computing resources,
particularly for high level theories such as coupled cluster with polynomial scaling.
Similar to earlier investigations of coupled cluster properties, we demonstrate that
the use of single-precision arithmetic reduces both the storage and multiplicative
costs of the real-time simulation by approximately a factor of two with no significant
impact on the resulting UV/vis absorption spectrum computed via the Fourier transform
of the time-dependent dipole moment.  Additional speedups --- of up to a factor of 14
in test simulations of water clusters --- are obtained via a straightforward GPU-based
implementation as compared to conventional CPU calculations.  We also find that
further performance optimization is accessible through sagacious selection of
numerical integration algorithms, and the adaptive methods, such as the Cash-Karp
integrator provide an effective balance between computing costs and numerical
stability.  Finally, we demonstrate that a simple mixed-step integrator based on the
conventional fourth-order Runge-Kutta approach is capable of stable propagations even
for strong external fields, provided the time step is appropriately adapted to the
duration of the laser pulse with only minimal computational overhead.
